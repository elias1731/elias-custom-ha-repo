Even Simpler, maybe not elegant BUT feature-rich CCTV/NVR for your cameras.

## About

motionEye is a popular frontend to the camera software called motion.

It's basically the motionEye Add-on without the better frontend.
= "motion" as standalone server.

I hope to achieve a smoother experience with camera streams on low-spec HA servers.

I haven't done a single performance test so far tbh.. So.. fingers crossed ig :)
